## Bug
I am facing a bug where dragging tasks horizontally are sluggish whereas dragging tasks vertically is much more real time.

## Steps to reproduce:
1. go to dashboard with tasks
2. hover task to see vertical grips
3. bug: drag task side to side and notice task is lagging behind cursor

## Expected behaviour: dragging tasks horizontally and vertically should be quick, real time and snappy

## Solution implemented:
ðŸ”§ **Fixed horizontal dragging performance issues** by:

1. **Replaced PointerSensor with MouseSensor + TouchSensor** - eliminates sticky/jump behavior
2. **Removed activation constraints** - provides immediate drag response 
3. **Optimized collision detection** - switched to closestCenter for better cursor tracking
4. **Enhanced CSS transforms** - use translate3d for hardware acceleration
5. **Added performance optimizations** - touch-action, will-change, conditional transitions
6. **Improved TypeScript compliance** - proper interfaces, error handling
7. **Updated tests** - reflect new sensor configuration

The drag and drop now provides smooth, real-time horizontal and vertical dragging that closely follows the cursor without lag or jumping behavior.
