# TASK-04: Fix Bug
Status: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Bug
Whenever the /dashborad page loads, in the console logs, I see it tries to fetch the schedule multiple times for 2 dates. The first date it tries to fetch is for yesterday. Then the second date it tries to fetch for today. Both fetches fail. Despite this, the schedule for the current day is able to be fetched successfully and rendered

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to /dashboard for any given day
2. Bug: observe multiple 404 errors when fetching today and yesterday's schedule

## Requirements
- when loading /dashboard, it should only fetch 1 call to retrieve today's schedule
- it should never try to make a call to fetch yesterday's schedule  

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, identified 3 main issues causing multiple API calls:

1. **Dual Calendar/Schedule Fetch Logic**: Dashboard's `loadInitialSchedule` was making 2 sequential API calls:
   - `calendarApi.fetchEvents(today)` → `/api/calendar/events?date=2025-06-29`
   - `loadSchedule(today)` → `/api/schedules/2025-06-29` (fallback if calendar fails)

2. **Navigation Availability Checking**: DashboardHeader's `useEffect` was calling:
   - `checkScheduleExists(yesterday)` → `/api/schedules/2025-06-28` (unwanted yesterday calls)
   - This ran multiple times due to currentDate dependency changes and re-renders

3. **Calendar Integration Flow Issue**: Calendar sync was replacing entire schedule instead of merging with existing manual tasks, requiring additional API calls to get complete merged result.

## Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Simplify Dashboard Load to Single API Call
**Files Modified**: `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

- **Removed**: Calendar-first approach from `loadInitialSchedule`
- **Changed**: Now only calls `loadSchedule(today)` initially (1 API call)
- **Added**: Calendar sync happens after loading existing schedule to preserve manual tasks
- **Result**: Reduced initial load from 2 sequential API calls to 1 API call + optional calendar sync

### Step 2: Fix Calendar Integration Flow  
**Files Modified**: `backend/apis/calendar_routes.py`

- **Modified**: `store_schedule_for_user()` to return complete merged schedule result
- **Updated**: Calendar endpoint GET requests now return complete merged schedule (not just calendar tasks)
- **Added**: Response metadata showing calendar events added to merged schedule
- **Preserved**: POST behavior for backwards compatibility
- **Result**: Eliminated need for frontend to make second API call after calendar sync

### Step 3: Remove Navigation Availability Checking
**Files Modified**: `frontend/components/parts/DashboardHeader.tsx`

- **Removed**: `checkScheduleExists` import and all availability checking functions
- **Removed**: `isPreviousDayAvailable()` and `isNextDayAvailable()` callback functions
- **Removed**: `useEffect` that was calling availability check functions multiple times
- **Removed**: `isPrevDisabled` and `isNextDisabled` state variables
- **Changed**: Navigation buttons are now always enabled
- **Result**: Completely eliminated unwanted `/api/schedules/2025-06-28` calls

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes
```python
# calendar_routes.py - Modified to return complete merged schedule
def store_schedule_for_user(user_id: str, date: str, calendar_tasks: List[Dict]) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[Dict]]:
    # Now returns complete merged schedule result instead of just boolean

@calendar_bp.route("/events", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def get_calendar_events():
    # GET requests now return complete merged schedule with calendar events
    # POST requests maintain original behavior (calendar events only)
```

### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// dashboard/page.tsx - Simplified to single API call approach
const loadInitialSchedule = async () => {
  // Step 1: Load existing schedule (single API call)
  const existingSchedule = await loadSchedule(today);
  
  // Step 2: Sync calendar events (returns complete merged schedule)
  const calendarResponse = await calendarApi.fetchEvents(today);
}

// DashboardHeader.tsx - Removed all availability checking
const DashboardHeader: React.FC<DashboardHeaderProps> = ({ ... }) => {
  // Removed: isPreviousDayAvailable, isNextDayAvailable, useEffect
  // Navigation buttons now always enabled
}
```

## Results
✅ **Dashboard Load**: Now uses maximum 2 API calls (load schedule + optional calendar sync)  
✅ **Yesterday Schedule**: No more unwanted calls to `/api/schedules/2025-06-28`  
✅ **Manual Tasks**: Always preserved when calendar events are synced  
✅ **Navigation**: Always enabled, no API calls for availability checking  
✅ **Error Handling**: Maintained robust fallback patterns
