## Problem
Current integration cards aren't standardised and look messy

## Requirements
- standardise integration card layout and UI
- display each integration card with w=300px and height=250px
- card should contain:
    - row 1:
        - logo top left
        - integration name text
    - row 2: 
        - short description
    - row 3:
        - CTAs

- default state: CTA should be purple "Connect"
- connected state: CTA should be a red "Disconnect"
- on hover: show dark shadow around card
