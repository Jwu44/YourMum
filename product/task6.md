# TASK-06: Fix Bug
Status: In Progress

## Bug
After editing the details of a task, the page elements becomes unclickable

### Steps to reproduce:
1. find a task on /dashboard
2. click horizontal ellipses
3. click 'Edit'
4. make changes
5a). Bug: clicking outside the drawer closes it, but now page elements are unclickable (e.g. checkboxes, buttons, etc...)
5b). Bug: OR clicking "Save Changes" closes the drawer, but now page elements are unclickable (e.g. checkboxes, buttons, etc...)
6. Changes to the task are reflected in the frontend and backend as observed after page refresh and checking mongodb entry 

## Requirements
- when editing task details, clicking outside the drawer should close the drawer but no changes should be saved. 
    - page elements should be clickable
- when editing task details then clicking "Save Changes", all changes to that task object should be updated in the backend and frontend so it persists. (logic already exists)
    - page elements should be clickable

## Detailed Investigation Results

### Root Cause Analysis ✅
**Primary Issue**: Vaul library's modal overlay persists after drawer closes, creating invisible barrier that blocks all page interactions.

**Technical Evidence**:
- `[data-state="open"]` elements remain in DOM after drawer closes
- `<body>` element has `pointer-events: none` style persisting 
- Multiple focus guard elements with `pointer-events: none` remain active
- Page appears normal visually but no interactive elements respond to clicks

**Code Issue**: Race condition between manual `onClose()` call in `handleSave()` and vaul's internal modal state management system.

### Current Architecture (Key Files)
- `frontend/components/parts/TaskEditDrawer.tsx` - The drawer component for editing tasks
- `frontend/components/parts/EditableScheduleRow.tsx` - Renders individual tasks, manages drawer state
- `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Contains `handleScheduleTaskUpdate()` function

### Investigation Findings
1. **✅ Backend Persistence**: Fixed - task updates now persist correctly
2. **❌ Frontend Unclickable Issue**: NOT FIXED - modal overlay cleanup failing

**Failed Approaches**:
- `setTimeout(() => onClose(), 0)` - doesn't resolve vaul's internal state management
- Direct `onClose()` calls create race condition with vaul's modal system

**Test Results** (2 failing tests):
✕ should call onUpdateTask with correct updated data (Race Condition Test)
✕ should properly cleanup modal state and not block interactions (Modal Overlay Test)

**Evidence from Tests**:
- `mockOnClose` never called (setTimeout doesn't execute in test environment)
- 4 elements with `pointer-events: none` persist after drawer closes
- `<body data-scroll-locked="1" style="pointer-events: none;">` remains active

### Solution Requirements
**Core Issue**: Need to eliminate race condition between manual `onClose()` and vaul's modal state management.

**Approach**: Let vaul handle the entire close process through its own state management instead of calling `onClose()` directly from `handleSave()`.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Remove direct `onClose()` call from `handleSave()`
2. Use vaul's `onOpenChange` callback as single source of truth for drawer state
3. Implement state flag to signal when save is complete
4. Let vaul's internal system handle modal overlay cleanup

### Next Steps
- Implement proper vaul state management integration
- Ensure all modal cleanup happens through vaul's system
- Verify tests pass and manual testing confirms clickable page after drawer closes
