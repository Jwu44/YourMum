# Task: Implement First-Time User Onboarding Tour

As a new user opening YourMum for the first time,
I want to be guided through the main features using a step-by-step interactive tour,
So that I can quickly understand how to use key functions and feel confident navigating YourMum.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The tour launches automatically on first use and can be closed at any time.
- Each step highlights a relevant UI element with a callout and concise explanation.
- Navigation buttons ("Next", "Close") are clearly visible and accessible.
- My position in the tour (e.g., "1 of 3") is always visible so I know how many steps remain.
- The overlay does not block essential functionality, allowing me to see and understand the interface beneath.
- All instructions use clear, jargon-free language and are easy to follow.
- Once the tour is closed, user should not be able to bring it back up

## Components Breakdown
- Highlight/Overlay: A translucent overlay that dims the background, focusing the userâ€™s attention on the active step.
- Callout content box:
    - title
    - divider
    - body text descriptive text (clear, concise, emphasizes action or learning).
    - step counter (e.g. 1 of 3)
    - CTA 1: Next 
- Content box is positioned contextually near the highlighted UI element using an pointed arrow to visually link the instructions to the feature being taught.

## Content for each step:
### Step 1

- body text: Click the button to add your first task. Simply add the task name. YourMum can auto-categorise this task later and even assign times.
