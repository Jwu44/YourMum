# USER-001: Schedule generation optimisation
Status: To Do

## Requirements
- Map out the current flow for generating a schedule by examining the code base
- In the first response, review the first step in the first flow by assessing its complexity
- Asess by asking:
    - Is this class/module/file/function too complex?
    - If so, what can be refactored to make it simpler?
    - Please look for opportunities to extract a class or a method for any bit of shared or repeated functionality, or just to result in better code organization
- When I am happy with the refactored response, continue the same process for the rest of the steps with each response focusing on 1 step

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Any necessary refactoring should follow @dev-guide.md 
2. Any necessary refactor should increase performance, scalability and be simple to understand
