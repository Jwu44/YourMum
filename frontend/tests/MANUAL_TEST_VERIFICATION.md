# Manual Test Verification - TASK-22 Fix

## Test Scenario: Google SSO + Calendar Connection Flow

### Before Fix (Double Load Issue):
1. Sign in via Google SSO with calendar access
2. Dashboard loads → Shows empty/loading state (no calendar events)
3. Calendar connection happens in background 
4. Dashboard reloads/re-renders → Now shows calendar events
5. **Result**: User sees two distinct loads

### After Fix (Single Load with Loader):
1. Sign in via Google SSO with calendar access
2. CalendarConnectionLoader appears with stages:
   - "Connecting to Google Calendar..." (connecting stage)
   - "Verifying Connection..." (verifying stage) 
   - "Calendar Connected!" (complete stage)
3. Dashboard loads once with calendar events already available
4. **Result**: User sees smooth loading experience, single dashboard load

## Automated Test Results:
✅ CalendarConnectionLoader shows during connection stages
✅ Different stages display correctly (connecting → verifying → complete)
✅ Normal dashboard renders when no connection stage is active

## Key Implementation Points:
- AuthContext tracks `calendarConnectionStage` during OAuth flow
- Dashboard checks this state and shows loader instead of dashboard
- Prevents race condition where dashboard loads before calendar connects
- Follows dev-guide.md simplicity and consistency principles

## Expected Log Flow (After Fix):
```
Sign in successful: Justin Wu (justin.wu4444@gmail.com)
Starting calendar connection process...
Connecting to Google Calendar...
Connected to Google Calendar successfully
Navigated to https://yourdai.app/dashboard
[Single dashboard load with calendar events already available]
```

## FINAL FIX VERIFICATION

### Issue Identified After Initial Fix:
Even with CalendarConnectionLoader working, there was still a double load occurring AFTER the loader completed due to `window.location.href = redirectTo` forcing a page reload.

### Root Cause (From Updated Logs):
1. CalendarConnectionLoader shows ✅
2. Calendar connects successfully ✅  
3. AuthContext calls `window.location.href = '/dashboard'` ❌
4. This causes full page reload even when already on /dashboard ❌
5. Result: Double dashboard load after CalendarConnectionLoader

### Final Fix Applied:
Modified AuthContext to check `window.location.pathname === redirectTo` before redirecting:
- **If already on target page**: Just clear `calendarConnectionStage` (no reload)
- **If different page**: Use `window.location.href` to navigate

### Expected Flow After Complete Fix:
1. User signs in via Google SSO with calendar access
2. CalendarConnectionLoader appears with progression:
   - "Connecting to Google Calendar..." (connecting)
   - "Verifying Connection..." (verifying) 
   - "Calendar Connected!" (complete)
3. `calendarConnectionStage` set to `null` (no page reload)
4. Dashboard renders once with calendar events already available
5. **Result**: Single load, smooth experience ✅

### Test Results:
✅ CalendarConnectionLoader shows during connection stages
✅ Different stages display correctly 
✅ Normal dashboard renders when no connection stage
✅ **NEW**: Prevents double load after calendar connection completes
✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE - FINAL FIX
The issue is now fully resolved. No more double dashboard loads after CalendarConnectionLoader.
