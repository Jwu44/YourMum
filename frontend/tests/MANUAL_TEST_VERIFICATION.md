# Manual Test Verification - TASK-22 Fix

## Test Scenario: Google SSO + Calendar Connection Flow

### Before Fix (Double Load Issue):
1. Sign in via Google SSO with calendar access
2. Dashboard loads → Shows empty/loading state (no calendar events)
3. Calendar connection happens in background 
4. Dashboard reloads/re-renders → Now shows calendar events
5. **Result**: User sees two distinct loads

### After Fix (Single Load with Loader):
1. Sign in via Google SSO with calendar access
2. CalendarConnectionLoader appears with stages:
   - "Connecting to Google Calendar..." (connecting stage)
   - "Verifying Connection..." (verifying stage) 
   - "Calendar Connected!" (complete stage)
3. Dashboard loads once with calendar events already available
4. **Result**: User sees smooth loading experience, single dashboard load

## Automated Test Results:
✅ CalendarConnectionLoader shows during connection stages
✅ Different stages display correctly (connecting → verifying → complete)
✅ Normal dashboard renders when no connection stage is active

## Key Implementation Points:
- AuthContext tracks `calendarConnectionStage` during OAuth flow
- Dashboard checks this state and shows loader instead of dashboard
- Prevents race condition where dashboard loads before calendar connects
- Follows dev-guide.md simplicity and consistency principles

## Expected Log Flow (After Fix):
```
Sign in successful: Justin Wu (justin.wu4444@gmail.com)
Starting calendar connection process...
Connecting to Google Calendar...
Connected to Google Calendar successfully
Navigated to https://yourdai.app/dashboard
[Single dashboard load with calendar events already available]
```

## Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The fix successfully prevents double dashboard load by showing CalendarConnectionLoader during the OAuth calendar connection process.
