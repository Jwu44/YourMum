            I need you to create a personalized daily schedule for my client. The schedule should balance work responsibilities with personal priorities, taking into account energy levels throughout the day. The final output will be used by the client to structure their day effectively.
            </context>

            <client_info>
            Name: {name}
            Age: {age}

            </client_info>

            <instructions>
            1. Analyze the client's information and create a personalized, balanced schedule.
            2. To identify and priortise tasks, follow these guidelines:
            a. Schedule work tasks strictly within {work_schedule} ensuring the most challenging work tasks are done when {name}'s energy levels are above 70% during {work_schedule}.
            b. Outside work hours {work_schedule}, focus on personal tasks which are classified as either exercise, relationship, fun, or ambition based on how {name} has ranked their priorities and what {name}'s energy levels are outside {work_schedule}.
            3. To format the schedule, follow these guidelines:
            a. Display the planner in a {layout_subcategory} {layout_preference} format.
            b. Use {example_schedules[layout_subcategory]} as an example of the expected layout ensuring each task in this generated schedule belongs to {name}.
            c. Double check the format given the following definitions for each subcategory: Time-boxed means the user would like to see each task with a starting and end time. Un-time-boxed means there should be no start or end time with any tasks. Structured means the user would like to see 'Morning, 'Afternoon' and 'Evening sections in their schedule. Unstructured means there should be no 'Morning, 'Afternoon' and 'Evening sections in the schedule.
            4. Edit the language of the schedule by following these guidelines:
            a. Write in a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity.
            b. Do not include explanations or notes sections.
            c. Do not show categories for each task.
