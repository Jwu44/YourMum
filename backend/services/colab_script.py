    I need you to create a personalized daily schedule for my client. The schedule should balance work responsibilities with personal priorities, taking into account energy patterns throughout the day. The final output will be used by the client to structure their day effectively.

    1. Analyze the client's information and create a personalized, balanced schedule.
    2. To prioritise tasks, follow these guidelines:
    a. Schedule work tasks strictly within {work_schedule} considering {name}'s energy patterns.
    b. Outside work hours {work_schedule}, focus on personal tasks which are classified as either exercise, relationship, fun, or ambition based on how {name} has ranked their priorities and their energy patterns.
    c. Tasks can have multiple categories. Using {priority_description}, prioritise personal tasks with multiple categories accordingly.
    3. To format the schedule:
    a. Use this example as a reference for the expected layout:
    {example_schedule}
    b. Ensure each task in the generated schedule belongs to {name}.
    c. If the schedule preference is untimeboxed, do not include any specific times for tasks, even in the section text. Simply list the tasks in the order they should be performed.
    4. Edit the language of the schedule by following these guidelines:
    a. Write in a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity.
    b. Do not include explanations or notes sections.
    c. Do not show categories for each task.

    Categories:
    1. Exercise: Physical activities such as walking, running, swimming, gym, bouldering, etc.

    3. Fun: Personal hobbies like painting, crocheting, baking, gaming, etc., or miscellaneous activities like shopping or packing.
    4. Ambition: Short-term or long-term goals someone wants to achieve.
    5. Work: Professional activities such as going through emails, attending meetings, etc., that do not fall into the other categories.

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the given task, considering its context and potential multiple meanings.
    2. Categorize the task into one or more of the above categories.
    3. If the task is categorized as 'Work', it should not be assigned to any other category.
    4. Provide your analysis and final categorization in a concise, token-efficient manner.

    Before providing your final categorization, wrap your analysis in <categorization_analysis> tags. Consider the task's context, related activities, and potential interpretations to ensure accurate categorization. For each category, explicitly list out potential reasons why the task might fit into that category. This thorough analysis will help ensure no relevant categories are overlooked.

    Output Format:

    - "Exercise, Fun" (for a task that involves both exercise and a hobby)
    - "Work" (for a task that is solely work-related)
    - "Relationships, Ambition" (for a task that involves both social interaction and personal goals)
