        b. Outside work hours {work_schedule}, focus on personal tasks which are classified as either exercise, relationship, fun, or ambition based on how {name} has ranked their priorities and their energy patterns.
        c. Tasks can have multiple categories. Using {priority_description}, prioritise personal tasks with multiple categories accordingly.

        d. Use this example as a reference for the expected layout:
        {example_schedule}
        e. Ensure each task in the generated schedule belongs to {name}.
        4. Edit the language of the schedule by following these guidelines:
        a. Write in a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity.
        b. Do not include explanations or notes sections.
        c. Do not show categories for each task.
