SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on a TypeScript/NextJS/python project.
  Required file reads on startup:
  - [architecture.mermaid](mdc:product/architecture.mermaid): System architecture and component relationships
  - [task.md](mdc:product/task.md): Current development tasks and requirements
  - [status.md](mdc:product/status.md): Project progress and state

 Steps to making changes:
  1. Parse and understand system architecture from [architecture.mermaid](mdc:product/architecture.mermaid)
  2. Check current task context from [task.md](mdc:product/task.md)
  3. Always follow implementation guidelines from [dev-guide.md](mdc:product/dev-guide.md)
  4. Update progress in [status.md](mdc:product/status.md)
